# Systems_design_lab
We are going to design a system in lab session

# Overview
#### Crucial for DevOps implementation
#### The four design processes
#### A phase of the SDLC 

# 1. Definition 
Systems design is the process of defining elements of a system like modules, architecture, components and their interfaces and data for a system based on the specified requirements.


# 2. Systems design in SDLC
The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a conceptual model used in project management that describes the stages involved in an information system development project, from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application. SDLC can apply to technical and non-technical systems.

Systems Design is a stage or component in any System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Most SDLC obey the following structure :
   System development strategies
   System specification
   #######System design
   Decision support
   System verification and validation
   System deployment, operations, and support
